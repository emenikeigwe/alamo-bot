# Alamo Bot

I made this bot to notify me over text (and via the Star Wars cantina song) whenever tickets opened up for sold-out showings (particularly Q&A sessions) at Alamo Drafthouse. I'm not bragging but this project got me within a few feet of Emma Stone... 

DISCLAIMER: This is very much not a representation of proper code. I wrote it for myself really. I hope to go back when I find the time to fully finish this project so that others may also enjoy the wonder that is Alamo Drafthouse.
